/* Exercise 8-02: A version of minimal stdio functions implemented with fields instead of bits
 *
 * NOTE: Compare timings and size with minstdiotest.c
 */

// The approach taken with the 'minstdio0' based upon bit fields is slower (142 clock ticks vs 129) and the compiled
// binary is larger (9,976 bytes vs 9,968) than the approach taken by 'minstdio' which uses bit manipulation

/*@ -retvalint -type -retvalother -nullpass */

// Includes

#include <time.h>   // used to time process

#include "minstdio0.h"
