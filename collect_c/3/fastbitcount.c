/*
 * fastbitcount
 *
 * Implements a fast version of bitcount().  bitcount() returns the number of 1-bits contained
 * within it's integer argument.  The fast version of it does this by using a two's complement
 * approach to delete the rightmost bit in 'x'.
 *
 * This approach uses 'x &= (x - 1)' to delete the rightmost bit in 'x'.
 *
 * To see how this works, let's work a few examples:
 *
 *     Say x = 275 which is '0b0000000100010011' assuming 16-bit word length.
 *
 *     x minus 1 is '0b0000000100010010' which, when ANDed with the above (which is what &= does), yields:
 *
 *                    x: 0b0000000100010011
 *                x - 1: 0b0000000100010010
 *                       ------------------
 *          x & (x - 1): 0b0000000100010010
 *
 *     Which has effectively deleted the rightmost bit of 'x'.
 *
 *     Another example where the rightmost bit is already zero:
 *
 *                    x: 0b0000001011100010 (738)
 *                x - 1: 0b0000001011100001
 *                       ------------------
 *          x & (x - 1): 0b0000001011100000
 *
 *      Which has also effectively deleted the rightmost bit of 'x'.
 *
 *      Let's try a negative number of -532.  532 is '0x0000001000010100'.  It's negative value in two's
 *      complement is 0x1111110111101100'. Therefore:
 *
 *                    x: 0b1111110111101100 (-532)
 *                x - 1: 0b1111110111101011 (-533)
 *                       ------------------
 *          x & (x - 1): 0b1111110111101000
 *
 *       Which has also deleted the right most bit of 'x'
